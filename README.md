## odoo modules practice

This is a practice to learn the essential aspects of Odoo.

### Observations

#1 Module information must be added to the __init__.py file for Odoo to detect modules correctly. If this information is not added, Odoo will not create the tables for the models.

#2 The data files within module directories are employed to populate the database with initial records. To ensure correct data loading, file names must align with their corresponding model names.
